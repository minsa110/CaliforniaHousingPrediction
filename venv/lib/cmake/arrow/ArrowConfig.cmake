# This config sets the following variables in your project::
#
#   ARROW_FULL_SO_VERSION - full shared library version of the found Arrow
#   ARROW_SO_VERSION - shared library version of the found Arrow
#   ARROW_VERSION - version of the found Arrow
#   ARROW_* - options used when the found Arrow is build such as ARROW_COMPUTE
#   Arrow_FOUND - true if Arrow found on the system
#
# This config sets the following targets in your project::
#
#   arrow_shared - for linked as shared library if shared library is built
#   arrow_static - for linked as static library if static library is built
